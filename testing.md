Testing:

1. Spelling, Grammar, Punctuation
Checked for typos, grammar, and proper punctuation throughout all site pages. Pay special

2. Fonts
Went through the copy checking to see that the formatting is consistent, looked and for odd blips in the copy.

3. Live URLs
All links to external websites, other webpages within the site and links to images have been 
checked and verified that they work properly.

4. Title Tags/Meta Data
Made sure that every page has a unique title tag. 

5. Compatibility
Tested the website on Google Chrome, Firefox Mozilla and Safari.

6. Images
The images do not display text renders when hovered over, but all the alt attributes are there. Every image displays 
correctly. All images posted are formated as jpg with onlt one exception for the ARB link image which is a PNG. 
All photographs are stored as JPG, and the ARB logo is a simple image/icon and stored as a PNG.

The photographs on the projects.html page load slightly slower. I think it is because of the size but I havent 
worked out how to solve that issue.

7. Social Media Integration
All social media icons on the site go to the correct pages. Social Media buttons are easily identfiable and 
located on the footer of every page.

8. Site Loading Speed & Responsive
Using Google Test My Site I was able to test the loading speed on mobile 3G devices and it is good - within 2 seconds. 
I also tested the responsiveness of my site with the toggle device bar on the Google inspect page.

9. Tested my CSS with W3C CSS Validator for any syntax errors or uneccessary code. Did the same for my HTML,
used W3C HTML checker. Using Google Chrome Developer Tools I was able to test different aspects of my code like the grid and 
spacing. I also used the tools to make sure my Mobile first approach works, ie. testing on different devices.


Deployment
Having started working on the website skeleton locally on my computer, using Atom code editor. I then created a reposetory on 
GitHub, this is where I have diployed my code. Once all my code is on the GitHub reposetory, I went on editing the project. 
Everytime I make a change, I follow up by staging the changes and then commiting them.
