                    <p>Variant Office is a south London-based practice. With roots in spatial design, we bring together many years of experience in architecture, design, planning and construction to secure the success of a wide variety of projects.</p>
                    <p>The ethos of Variant Office is rooted in design research, user-centricity and a commitment to exploring the ability of space to transform lives and experiences through the careful engagement with both the client’s requirements and sensitivity to the site.</p>
                    <p>Through our practice we have been exploring how to work with a range of people and processes at different scales, to create solutions that are both inspiring, participatory and revel in the joy of unexpected possibility.
                    We are excited about the discovery of new materials and innovative ways of arranging them. We work closely with artists and craftspeople, and collaborate with them to explore heritage and new techniques to building and creating spaces.
                    We believe the process is as important as the product.</p>
