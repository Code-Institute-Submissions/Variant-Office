Variant Office
This project is a website for an emerging architectural company called Variant Office. 
It's a young company consisting of three technically skilled and dynamic architects. Their work is comprised of stripped down 
and understated engineering. Approaching every project with a minimal outlook, their brand and so the website design style 
has to mirror that approach.


UX
This project is for a group of architects that care about aesthetics and detail. Their main objective with the site is to 
showcase the work they have done and the projects they are currently working on. Although they are young and the work they 
conduct is usually contemporary, they are just as enthused by period work. In designing the website, I have incorporated a modern and 
sleek look onto the style of the website. At the same time the site is still simple and familiar in the way it's laid out. 

There is a traditional looking navigation which goes along the top of the site, with the company logo clearly visible for the user
to see. The botton fo the site has an uncomplicated footer with links to the company's social media networks for interested users.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

Features Left to Implement
Another feature idea
Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.

Functionality & Technology:
The website is meant to give visitors an idea of who the architects are and what kind of work do they do.
showcasing some of the work they ahve conducted inluding links to their social media platform where 
potential clients can engage with them. 

Mainly used Bootstrap 4 when creating the site. I have customized a lot of the Bootstrap code
in order to make it work for this project. I have also employed a simple Java script code for the carousel.


Social-Links & Nav-Titles:
Used the same CSS hover styling for both in order to have a recognisable theme.

Testing:
Tested my CSS with W3C CSS Validator for any syntax errors or uneccessary code. Did the same for my HTML,
used W3C HTML checker. Using Google Chrome Developer Tools I was able to test different aspects of my code like the grid and 
spacing. I also used the tools to make sure my Mobile first approach works, ie. testing on different devices.
