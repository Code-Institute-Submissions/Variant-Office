Variant Office Website

This project is a website for an emerging architectural company called Variant Office. It's a young company consisting 
of three principle architects with technical and dynamic skillset. Employing a stripped down and understated engineering style, 
their approach echos the minimal outcome of their projects, and so does the website design style.

The website has a contemporary but simple and familiar layout. The home page gives a clean and precise visual, the company 
logo on the top left clearly stands out so that visitors to the site can immediately know where they are. The "About" menu 
item consist of a brief description of the company and the summerised profiles of the three compony directors. The "Projects" 
menu item has a detailed showcase of the work that the company does. Consisting of a grid with images and video content 
describing past projects. This is the part of the website that users would visit the most as it has more infomartion, 
but visually and in text. The "Categories" and "Research" menu items would consist of more detailed information on past, 
current and future projects that Variant Office is involved in. Projects would be grouped according to their genre and 
specificity. The user will be able to see the beginning stages of a project, from the architects initial design sketches,
research notes, to the final finished product. The last menu item allows for users to contact the the company by phone or
email. Full address and a map is also available there, if anyone trying to find the location of the company office.
All menu items have social media links and architectural accreditation for the company.

This website is for people who are looking to build a property from scratch or improve something already existing. 
The individuals visiting this website would be looking for architecture with contemporary aesthetics, attention to detail 
and inspired design. The website provides examples of the work that the company has undertaken, it also has vides of 
clients speaking about the work the company has done. There is a contacts page for individuals who want to get in touch 
directly with the architects. Each page has a link to the company's social media for people who prefer engaging with the 
in that way.





There is a traditional looking navigation which goes along the top of the site, with the company logo clearly visible for 
the user to see. The botton fo the site has an uncomplicated footer with links to the company's social media networks for 
interested users. In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the 
following general structure:

User: 1
I have recently acquired a small sight in a built-up urban area. Looking for an architect who can build modest but modern and
environmentally friendly projects. I would like to know about the architects background, experience and also have a look at their 
recent work. I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal. Please find supporting sketches and wireframe drawings 
under the diagrams folder inside Images.

Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools 
that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site 
and a short sentence of why it was used.

Bootstrap:
The project uses Bootstrap templetes as a starting point for the developer to costomise accordingly.
Bootstrap makes the build go quicker and gives me the developer a blueprint from which to build upon.


Testing:
Please find 'testing.md' file.

Functionality & Technology:
The website is meant to give visitors an idea of who the architects are and what kind of work do they do.
showcasing some of the work they ahve conducted inluding links to their social media platform where 
potential clients can engage with them. 

Mainly used Bootstrap 4 when creating the site. I have customized a lot of the Bootstrap code
in order to make it work for this project. I have also employed a simple Java script code for the carousel.

Inspiration:
When creating the projects.html page, I used the base code from (https://mdbootstrap.com/javascript/bootstrap-gallery/#modals)
but I modified and added my take to it.


Social-Links & Nav-Titles:
Used the same CSS hover styling for both in order to have a recognisable theme.
