Variant Office
This project is a website for an emerging architectural company called Variant Office. 
It's a young company consisting of three technically skilled and dynamic architects. Their work is comprised of stripped down 
and understated engineering. Approaching every project with a minimal outlook, their brand and so the website design style 
has to mirror that approach.


UX
This project is for a group of architects that care about aesthetics and detail. Their main objective with the site is to 
showcase the work they have done and the projects they are currently working on. Although they are young and the work they 
conduct is usually contemporary, they are just as enthused by period work. In designing the website, I have incorporated a modern and 
sleek look onto the style of the website. At the same time the site is still simple and familiar in the way it's laid out. 

There is a traditional looking navigation which goes along the top of the site, with the company logo clearly visible for the user
to see. The botton fo the site has an uncomplicated footer with links to the company's social media networks for interested users.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

User: 1
I have recently acquired a small sight in a built-up urban area. Looking for an architect who can build modest but modern and
environmentally friendly projects. I would like to know about the architects background, experience and also have a look at their 
recent work. I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal. Please find supporting sketches and wireframe drawings 
under the diagrams folder inside Images.

Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools 
that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site 
and a short sentence of why it was used.

Bootstrap:
The project uses Bootstrap templetes as a starting point for the developer to costomise accordingly.
Bootstrap makes the build go quicker and gives me the developer a blueprint from which to build upon.


Testing:
Please find 'testing.md' file.

Functionality & Technology:
The website is meant to give visitors an idea of who the architects are and what kind of work do they do.
showcasing some of the work they ahve conducted inluding links to their social media platform where 
potential clients can engage with them. 

Mainly used Bootstrap 4 when creating the site. I have customized a lot of the Bootstrap code
in order to make it work for this project. I have also employed a simple Java script code for the carousel.




Social-Links & Nav-Titles:
Used the same CSS hover styling for both in order to have a recognisable theme.
