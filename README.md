Project:
This project is a website for an imerging architectural company called Variant Office. 
Its a young company consisting of three technically skilled and dynamic architects. Their work is comprised of stripped down 
and understated engineering. Approaching every project with a minimal outlook, their brand and so the website design style 
has to mirror that approach.

Functionality & Technology:
The website is meant to give visitors an idea of who the architects are and what kind of work do they do.
showcasing some of the work they ahve conducted inluding links to their social media platform where 
potential clients can engage with them. 

Mainly used Bootstrap 4 when creating the site. I have customized a lot of the Bootstrap code
in order to make it work for this project. I have also employed a simple Java script code for the carousel.


Social-Links & Nav-Titles:
Used the same CSS hover styling for both in order to have a recognisable theme.

Testing:
Tested my CSS with W3C CSS Validator for any syntax errors or uneccessary code. Did the same for my HTML,
used W3C HTML checker. Using Google Chrome Developer Tools I was able to test different aspects of my code like the grid and 
spacing. I also used the tools to make sure my Mobile first approach works, ie. testing on different devices.
